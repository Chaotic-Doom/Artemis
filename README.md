# Artemis

A kotlin discord library. Not meant for use. Just made it for learning. Taken inspiration (but didn't look at code from) [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [Discord4J](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J).

If you're crazy enough to use the library you can get some support on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/StFAvnn) (but really go use D4J)
